# Wine-Quality-Classification

Executed on Kaggle, this project delves into a Wine Quality Dataset, employing classification algorithms to discern the quality of wines based on diverse factors pertaining to wine, such as, fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfhur dioxide, alcohol percentage, etc. 

For this project I used Python, I conducted thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover feature correlations and scrutinized value distributions within each quality class. Implemented strategic SMOTE sampling techniques to balance dataset proportions and enhance prediction accuracy. I leveraged the RandomForestClassification model, optimizing parameters through a grid search technique and assessing performance via confusion matrix. In addition to the SMOTE techniques, I also tried dropping features which seemed to have low correlation with the output variable (wine quality). 

Through this project, I have realised the importance of handling imbalanced datasets and how oversampling and undersampling can lead to overfitting.
